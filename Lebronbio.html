         <h1><strong><u>Lebron James Biography</u></strong></h1>
         <p>Born December 30, 1984, in Akron, OH; son of Gloria James.

            </p>
            <p>No player in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA) has received so much attention so early in his career as LeBron James, the 18-year-old who was selected as number-one draft pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2003 NBA draft. For James, however, this kind of attention was nothing new: Ever since his freshman year in high school, James had been hailed as the next basketball superstar—the heir apparent to Michael Jordan, the retired Chicago Bulls star who many view as the best to play the game. The expectations facing James in his rookie year were immense: In Cleveland, he was viewed as a potential savior for a franchise that had struggled for years to reach the playoffs; in the NBA as a whole, he was greeted as a potential crossover marketing phenomenon who could spur sales of licensed products and tickets, and help polish the image of a league whose best young players made news as much for their legal court appearances as their play on the basketball.</p>

                <p>James took his first step toward realizing the expectations of many observers when he completed a successful first season in the NBA and was crowned the got milk? Rookie of the Year in April of 2004. Statistically, the 6′ 8″, 240-pound forward placed in the top five among rookies in all the major categories: He led in steals at 1.65 per game; was second in scoring, behind Carmelo Anthony, with 20.9 points per game; placed third in assists, with 5.9 per game; and was fifth in rebounding, with 5.5 boards per game. He became just the third rookie ever to average more than 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game, joining legends Oscar Robertson and Jordan. James led Rookie of the Year voting, taking 78 first place votes to 40 for fellow phenom Anthony. Most importantly to James himself—who says he is playing for his team, not his personal stats—he helped the Cavaliers more than double their victory totals from the previous year, though their 35-47 record did not earn a playoff berth.
